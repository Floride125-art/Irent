        <h2>Our Services</h2>
        <p class="pserv"> Our services are grouped into two categories whereby one catergory focuses on the tenants and the other category focuces on the landlords.
            To start with tenants, I would like to say that we work with different tenants by facilitating them to find the houses for renting easily without
            wasting most of their time or money. With our online platform we are able to provide enough information about different houses available for renting 
            whereby whenever a client is looking for a houses to rent, she or he can be able to find that right home to rent depending on the kind of houses
            they are looking. We work with tenants before and after getting houses by getting feed back from them on how statisfied they are toward the houses they
            were looking for, like if they found it exactly the way they wanted it. There is also a payment notifications remind tenants the due dates of rent payments
            in order to help them to remember payment date.
        </p>
        <p class="pserv1">To continue with the other category of our service which focuses on the landlords, I would like to say that we work with different 
            landlords who are having houses for renting by publishing thoses houses online to be seen by different tenants and also help them in management of their 
        properties. As long as landlords will be paid at the end of month, or a year due to the specific period of time they have agreed on together with tenants,
        there is always a notifications sent to them as a reminder of due date of rent payment. That simply help them in better management of their properties 
        and also get to be paid on time. 
     </p>
     <p class="pserv2"> Thus, we are here for you. We always strive for the best of our clients because we know that you are most appreciated people in this world
         You are always welcomes to our services.
